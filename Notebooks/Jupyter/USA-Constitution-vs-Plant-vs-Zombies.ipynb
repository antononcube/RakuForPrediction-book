    "In this notebook we ingest the text of the [US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States), [Wk1], and use it as a part of different Large Language Model (LLM) requests, like, summaries and most important statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use LLM to derive analogies with the game [\"Plants vs Zombies\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies), [Wk2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization of those analogies is an interesting task, and we apply OpenAI's model DALL-E 3 to generate (mostly) relevant images. (Following [AA2].)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the idea to apply LLMs to the US Constitution should have ocurred in many (human) heads. For example, see the GitHub repository [\"ConstitutionGPT\"](https://github.com/vdutts7/constitutionGPT), [VD7r1]. (Also see these [search results](https://github.com/topics/us-constitution).)\n",
    "\n",
    "The US Constitution is popular, well known document, hence, it is expected LLMs to be able to \"converse about it\" without providing its full text in the prompts. Nevertheless, below we do ingest the full text of the US Constitution and include in our LLM interactions. That makes the presented LLM workflows (fairly) text independent.\n",

       "Alright, let's break this down into something more relatable to a \"Plants vs. Zombies\" player. Imagine the United States Constitution and its Bill of Rights as the ultimate game guide for running a country, where the goal is to ensure a balanced, fair, and free society, much like strategizing to protect your garden from zombies.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Preamble (Introduction):** This is like the game's intro screen, setting the stage. It tells us why the Constitution was created: to make a better \"team\" (union), ensure peace at home, provide defense, improve everyone's well-being, and guarantee freedom for now and the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Article 1: Legislative Branch (Congress)** - Think of Congress as two different types of plants in your garden, the Senate and the House of Representatives, each with unique powers and responsibilities. They make the rules (laws) of the game, deciding how resources are distributed, how to defend against threats, and how to keep the garden (country) running smoothly.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Article 2: Executive Branch (President and Administration)** - This is like choosing your main plant or hero, the President, who executes the laws made by Congress, leads the military, and deals with other gardens (countries). The President has a team (administration) to help manage specific areas, like defense or agriculture.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Article 3: Judicial Branch (Supreme Court and other Federal Courts)** - Imagine this as the game's referees or rule-checkers. They interpret the laws, settle disputes, and ensure that everything aligns with the game guide (Constitution). They make sure everyone plays fair.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bill of Rights (First 10 Amendments):** These are like the essential power-ups or protections for the players (citizens) to ensure they can play the game freely and fairly.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Freedom Power-Up:** You can speak, write, gather, and believe freely.\n",
       "2. **Defense Boost:** You have the right to hold onto and use tools (in this case, weapons) for protection.\n",
       "3. **Privacy Shield:** Soldiers can't just crash at your place without permission.\n",
       "4. **Anti-Spyware:** Your personal space and belongings can't be searched or taken without a good reason.\n",
       "5. **Fair Play Protocol:** You have rights in legal situations, like not having to incriminate yourself and being treated fairly by the law.\n",
       "6. **Rapid Response:** In legal battles, you're guaranteed a quick and public trial, with a chance to defend yourself.\n",
       "7. **Trial by Jury:** For serious disputes in court, you can have a jury decide.\n",
       "8. **No Cheat Codes:** Punishments can't be overly harsh or unfair.\n",
       "9. **Hidden Levels:** Just because a right isn't listed here doesn't mean you don't have it.\n",
       "10. **Local Control:** Powers not given to the federal government belong to the states or the people.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rest of the amendments (11-27) are like updates or expansions to the game, adding new features, fixing bugs, or adjusting the gameplay to make sure it stays fair and fun for everyone playing.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, just like in \"Plants vs. Zombies,\" where you need to know your plants, zombies, and strategies to win, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights lay out the rules, roles, and protections to ensure the game of governance is played effectively and fairly for all citizens."
