## Simply put


1. **R is arcane**.
   * It has a steep learning curve.
   * It is not very intuitive.
   * It is full of quirks and oddities.
2. **R has all the features of a design by a committee**.
   * It is a general-purpose language.
   * It is extensible.
   * It has a large ecosystem of packages.
3. **R cannot suffer the LISP curse**.
   * It is not a purely functional language.
   * It has mutable data structures.
   * It is not as prone to errors as LISP.

## 1. R is arcane

>...  .
   * It has a steep learning curve.
   * It is not very intuitive.
   * It is full of quirks and oddities.


 * **R has a steep learning curve.** This is because it is a programming language, and programming languages can be difficult to learn. R also has a lot of features, which can make it overwhelming for beginners.
* **R is not very intuitive.** This is because it is not a language that is designed to be easy to use. It is designed for power users who need a lot of flexibility and control.
* **R is full of quirks and oddities.** This is because it is a very old language that has been evolving over time. As a result, it has a lot of features that are no longer used, and it can be difficult to find documentation for these features.

Overall, R is a powerful language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks. However, it is not a language that is easy to learn or use. It is best suited for experienced programmers who are looking for a lot of flexibility and control.

 R has all the features of a design by a committee: it is a general-purpose language, extensible, and has a large ecosystem of packages.

* **It is a general-purpose language.** R can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. It is also a good choice for teaching programming, as it is relatively easy to learn.
* **It is extensible.** R has a large number of packages that can be used to extend its functionality. These packages can be found on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
* **It has a large ecosystem of packages.** The R ecosystem is made up of the language itself, the CRAN packages, and the community of R users and developers. This ecosystem makes it easy to find help and resources for using R.

R is a powerful and versatile language that is well-suited for a wide variety of tasks. It is a good choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.

## 3. R cannot suffer the LISP curse

>...  .
   * It is not a purely functional language.
   * It has mutable data structures.
   * It is not as prone to errors as LISP.

 **R is not a purely functional language.** This means that it allows for mutable data structures, which are data structures that can be changed after they have been created. This is in contrast to purely functional languages, which only allow for immutable data structures, which cannot be changed after they have been created.

**R has mutable data structures.** This means that R is not as prone to errors as LISP, which is a purely functional language that only allows for immutable data structures. Because R allows for mutable data structures, it is possible to make changes to data after it has been created, which can lead to errors if the changes are not made correctly.

**R is not as prone to errors as LISP.** This is because R has mutable data structures, which allows for errors to be caught and corrected more easily than in LISP. In LISP, because data cannot be changed after it has been created, errors that are made in the creation of data cannot be corrected. In R, however, because data can be changed after it has been created, errors that are made in the creation of data can be caught and corrected more easily.
