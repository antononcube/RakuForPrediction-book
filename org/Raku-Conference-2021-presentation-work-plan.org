  - [X] First version of DSL Web Service functions
  - [X] More robust implementation with the library "httr"

  - [ ] Data wrangling over a predefined list of data?
  - [ ] LSA over a predefined list of text collections?

** DONE ExternalParserHookUp (Mathematica) [80%] [4/5]
- [X] Make it work with an OS process of sandboxed Raku through ZMQ
- [X] Test with Mathematica 12.3 Mac OS 11
- [X] Program the DSL Web Service access functions
- [X] Convert result code string into executable expression if specified
- [ ] Make sure DSL commands with misspellings show properly
  output-wise.
  - Turned out that was a hard problem to solve because of how:
    - ~warn~ and ~note~ behave.
** CANCELED RakuMode (Mathematica) [%] [/]
- [ ] Make a WRI resource function
- [ ] Test on Mac OS 11
- [ ] Test on Windows 10
** DONE ExternalParserHookUp (R) [25%] [1/4]
- [X] Program the DSL Web Service qaccess functions
  - [X] Simple
  - [X] More robust with ~httr::GET~
  - [X] Test with Shiny apps
- [ ] Make it work with an OS process of sandboxed Raku through ZMQ
- [ ] Test with RStudio on Mac OS 11
- [ ] Convert result code string into executable expression if specified
** DONE Cro Web Service [77%] [7/9] 
- [X] Add ~stderr~ content in the result JSON structure
- [X] Implement command for returning the AST
- [X] Examples in RStudio notebooks
- [X] Examples in Jupyter
- [X] Ability to specify the default language through the URL
  - For example:
    : http://localhost:10000/translate/R/'DSL MODULE SMRMon; create recommender with dfTitanic; recommend by profile male; echo value'
- [X] Better handling of interpreter failures
- [X] Shiny interface to antononcube.shinyapps.io.
- [ ] Better parallel search algorithm
- [ ] Separation of commands from multiple DSLs.
  - Here is /one/ pipeline:
    : DSL TARGET R::SMRMon;
    : use smrFreshTTR;
    : compute profile for history 'project manager';
    : assign pipeline value to lastResult
    : DSL TARGET R::tidyverse
    : use lastResult;
    : filter by Tag is like 'SkillsVector:'
  - The pipeline above:
    1) Has to be separated into strings of commands for two DSLs
    2) Each DSL-commands strings is interpreted
    3) The interpretation programming codes are stitched together
