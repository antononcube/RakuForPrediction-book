# 12 steps to quit Python

## Introduction

This computation Markdown document [AA1, AAv1] can be seen as a template for guide-documents using Large Language Model (LLMs), [AA2, Wk1].
See the references for more details of the underlying mechanics. (Written in Raku, [AA1, AA2, AAp1Ã·AAp3].)

**Remark:** The package 
["Text::CodeProcessing"](https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/Text::CodeProcessing), [AAp1],
has "code chunk" for accessing the LLMs OpenAI / ChatGPT, [AAp2], and PaLM, [AAp3].

**Remark:** Obviously, this introduction and the references at the bottom can be removed.

**Remark:** Note that the code chunk parameter specs.
The specs `results=asis, output-prompt=NONE` make the output to be "seamlessly" included in the result document.
The spec `echo=FALSE` "removes" the code chunk from the result document.

Here is a flowchart that summarizes the execution steps:

>...  Admit that you have a problem with Python programming.


 I admit that I have a problem with Python programming. I find it difficult to understand the syntax and the way that variables are declared. I also find it difficult to remember the different functions and methods that are available. As a result, I often make mistakes when I am writing Python code.

I am aware that this is a problem that I need to overcome if I want to become a better programmer. I am working on improving my understanding of Python by reading books, taking online courses, and practicing writing code. I am also trying to find a mentor who can help me to learn the ropes.

I know that it will take time and effort, but I am committed to learning Python. I believe that it is a powerful language that can be used to create amazing things. I am excited to see what I can accomplish with Python in the future.

>...  Make a list of all the reasons why you want to quit Python programming.


 1. **It's too hard to learn.** Python has a steep learning curve, and it can be difficult for beginners to get started. The syntax is complex, and there are a lot of different concepts to learn.
2. **It's not as fast as other languages.** Python is a slower language than some other programming languages, such as C++ or Java. This can be a problem for applications that require a lot of processing power.
3. **It's not as versatile as other languages.** Python is not as versatile as some other programming languages, such as Java or C#. It can be difficult to use Python for certain tasks, such as developing mobile applications or embedded systems.
4. **It's not as popular as other languages.** Python is not as popular as some other programming languages, such as Java or C++. This can make it difficult to find resources and support for Python programming.
5. **It's not the best language for every task.** Python is a good general-purpose programming language, but it's not the best language for every task. There are other languages that may be better suited for specific tasks, such as C++ for performance-critical applications or Java for enterprise development.

>...  Tell your friends and family about your decision to quit Python programming.


 Hi everyone,

I wanted to let you know that I've decided to quit Python programming. I know this may come as a surprise, but it's something that I've been thinking about for a while.

I've been programming in Python for the past few years, and I've enjoyed it a lot. It's a powerful language with a lot of versatility. However, I've come to realize that it's not the right language for me.

I'm a more visual thinker, and I find that I'm more productive when I'm using a language that's more closely aligned with my thought process. I've been experimenting with other languages, and I've found that I'm much more comfortable with JavaScript.

I know that this is a big change, but I'm excited about it. I think it's the best decision for me, and I'm confident that it will allow me to be more productive in my work.

I appreciate your understanding.

Thanks,
[Your name]
