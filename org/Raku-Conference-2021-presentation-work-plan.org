  - [X] Marshal-able JSON form
  - [ ] Raku
  - [ ] Mathematica
- [ ] Conjunction usage demonstrations
  - [ ] LSA to Classification
  - [ ] LSA to Recommendations
  - [ ] Data Acquisition to Data Wrangling
  - [ ] Data Wrangling to Classification
  - [ ] Data Acquisition to Data Wrangling to Classification
  - [ ] Large data Data Wrangling
** TODO ExternalParserHookUp (Mathematica) [80%] [4/5]
- [X] Make it work with an OS process of sandboxed Raku through ZMQ
- [X] Test with Mathematica 12.3 Mac OS 11
- [ ] Make sure DSL commands with misspellings show properly output-wise.
- [X] Program the DSL Web Service access functions
- [X] Convert result code string into executable expression if specified
** TODO RakuMode (Mathematica) 
- [ ] Make a WRI resource function
- [ ] Test on Mac OS 11
- [ ] Test on Windows 10
** TODO ExternalParserHookUp (R) [25%] [1/4]
- [X] Program the DSL Web Service access functions
  - [X] Simple
  - [X] More robust with ~httr::GET~
  - [X] Test with Shiny apps
- [ ] Make it work with an OS process of sandboxed Raku through ZMQ
- [ ] Test with RStudio on Mac OS 11
- [ ] Convert result code string into executable expression if specified
** TODO Cro Web Service [71%] [5/7] 
- [X] Add ~stderr~ content in the result JSON structure
- [X] Implement command for returning the AST
- [X] Examples in RStudio notebooks
- [X] Examples in Jupyter
- [X] Ability to specify the default language through the URL
  - For example:
    : http://localhost:10000/translate/R/'DSL MODULE SMRMon; create recommender with dfTitanic; recommend by profile male; echo value'
- [ ] Better parallel search algorithm
- [ ] Separation of commands from multiple DSLs.
  - Here is /one/ pipeline:
    : DSL TARGET R::SMRMon;
    : use smrFreshTTR;
    : compute profile for history 'project manager';
    : assign pipeline value to lastResult
    : DSL TARGET R::tidyverse
    : use lastResult;
    : filter by Tag is like 'SkillsVector:'
  - The pipeline above:
    1) Has to be separated into strings of commands for two DSLs
    2) Each DSL-commands strings is interpreted
    3) The interpretation programming codes are stitched together
