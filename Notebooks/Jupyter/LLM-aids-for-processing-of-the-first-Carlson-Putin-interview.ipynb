    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the LLM functions for programmatic access of LLMs speeds up the efforts, I would say, by factor 3-5 times.\n",
    "- The workflows presented below are fairly universal -- with small changes the notebook can be applied to other interviews.\n",
    "- Using OpenAI's preview model \"gpt-4-turbo-preview\" spares or simplifies a fair amount of workflow elements.\n",
    "    - The model \"gpt-4-turbo-preview\" takes input with 128K tokens, [OAIb1]. \n",
    "    - Hence the whole interview can be processed in one LLM request.\n",
    "- Since I watched the interview, I can see that the LLM results for most provocative questions or most important statements are good.\n",
    "    - It is interesting to think about believing those results by people who have not watched the interview.\n",
    "- The search engine can be replaced or enhanced with a Question Answering System (QAS).\n",
    "- The flavored variations might be too subtle.\n",
    "    - I expected more obvious manifestation of characters involved."

       "Based on the content and context of the interview between Tucker Carlson and President Vladimir Putin, identifying the top three most provocative questions involves subjective judgment. However, considering the potential for controversy, international implications, and the depth of response they elicited, the following three questions can be considered among the most provocative:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **NATO Expansion and Perceived Threats to Russia:**\n",
       "   - **Question:** \"On February 24, 2022, you addressed your country in your nationwide address when the conflict in Ukraine started and you said that you were acting because you had come to the conclusion that the United States through NATO might initiate a quote, “surprise attack on our country.” And to American ears that sounds paranoid. Tell us why you believe the United States might strike Russia out of the blue. How did you conclude that?\"\n",
       "   - **Context:** This question directly challenges Putin's justification for the military actions in Ukraine, suggesting paranoia, and seeks an explanation for Russia's perceived threat from NATO and the U.S., which is central to understanding the conflict's origins from Russia's perspective.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Possibility of Negotiated Settlement in Ukraine:**\n",
       "   - **Question:** \"Do you think Zelensky has the freedom to negotiate the settlement to this conflict?\"\n",
       "   - **Context:** This question probes the autonomy and authority of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the context of peace negotiations, implicitly questioning the influence of external powers (notably the U.S.) on Ukraine's decision-making and the potential for resolving the conflict through diplomacy.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Use of Nuclear Weapons and Global Conflict:**\n",
       "   - **Question:** \"Do you think NATO was worried about this becoming a global war or nuclear conflict?\"\n",
       "   - **Context:** Given the nuclear capabilities of Russia and the escalating tensions with NATO, this question touches on the fears of a broader, potentially nuclear, conflict. Putin's response could provide insights into Russia's stance on the use of nuclear weapons and its perception of NATO's concerns about escalation.\n",
       "\n",
       "These questions are provocative due to their direct challenge to Putin's actions and rationale, their exploration of sensitive geopolitical issues, and their potential to elicit responses that could have significant international repercussions."

       "\n",
       "1. **Vladimir Putin's assertion on NATO expansion and its impact on Russia**: Putin's repeated emphasis on NATO's expansion as a direct threat to Russia's security and the broken promises regarding NATO not expanding eastward. This is a critical point as it underlines Russia's longstanding grievance and justification for its actions in Ukraine, reflecting the deep-seated geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Putin's readiness for a negotiated settlement in Ukraine**: Putin's statements indicating a willingness to negotiate a settlement for the conflict in Ukraine, blaming the West and Ukraine for the lack of dialogue and suggesting that the ball is in their court to make amends and come back to the negotiating table. This is significant as it portrays Russia's stance on seeking a diplomatic resolution, albeit under conditions that are likely to favor Russian interests.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Discussion on the potential global implications of the conflict**: The dialogue around the fear of the conflict in Ukraine escalating into a larger, possibly global war, and the mention of nuclear threats. This highlights the high stakes involved not just for the immediate parties but for global security, underscoring the urgency and gravity of finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict.\n",
       "\n",

He provides a detailed historical account of the territorial changes and political maneuvers over the centuries, including the role of the Bolsheviks in establishing Soviet Ukraine and the allocation of territories post-World War II.\n",

       "<table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td>Mr. President, thank you.\n",
       "On February 24, 2022, you addressed your country in your nationwide address when the conflict in Ukraine started and you said that you were acting because you had come to the conclusion that the United States through NATO might initiate a quote, “surprise attack on our country.” And to American ears that sounds paranoid. Tell us why you believe the United States might strike Russia out of the blue. How did you conclude that?</td><td>What is denazification? What would that mean?</td><td>Well, let’s just give one example — the US dollar, which has, kind of, united the world in a lot of ways, maybe not to your advantage, but certainly to ours. Is that going away as the reserve currency, the universally accepted currency? How have sanctions, do you think, changed the dollar’s place in the world?</td></tr><tr><td>May I ask… You are making the case that Ukraine, certain parts of Ukraine, Eastern Ukraine, in fact, has been Russia for hundreds of years. Why wouldn’t you just take it when you became President 24 years ago? You have nuclear weapons, they don’t. It’s actually your land. Why did you wait so long?</td><td>Would you be satisfied with the territory that you have now?</td><td>I think that is a fair assessment. The question is what comes next? And maybe you trade one colonial power for another, much less sentimental and forgiving colonial power? Is the BRICS, for example, in danger of being completely dominated by the Chinese economy? In a way that is not good for their sovereignty. Do you worry about that?</td></tr><tr><td>In 1654?</td><td>Really, my question is: What do you do about it? I mean, Hitler has been dead for eighty years, Nazi Germany no longer exists, and it’s true. So, I think, what you are saying, you want to extinguish or at least control Ukrainian nationalism. But how do you do that?</td><td>So, you said a moment ago that the world would be a lot better if it were not broken into competing alliances, if there was cooperation globally. One of the reasons you don’t have that is because the current American administration is dead set against you. Do you think if there was a new administration after Joe Biden that you would be able to re-establish communication with the US government? Or does it not matter who the President is?</td></tr><tr><td>You have, I see, encyclopaedic knowledge of that region. But why didn’t you make this case for the first 22 years as president, that Ukraine wasn’t a real country?</td><td>Right. My question is almost specific, it was, of course, not a defense of Nazism. Otherwise, it was a practical question. You don&#39;t control the entire country, you don’t seem like you want to. So, how do you eliminate that culture, or an ideology, or feelings, or a view of history, in a country that you don’t control? What do you do about that?</td><td>But you are describing two different systems. You say that the leader acts in the interests of the voters, but you also say that these decisions are not made by the leader – they are made by the ruling classes. You have run this country for so long, you have known all these American presidents. What are those power centres in the United States, do you think? And who actually makes the decisions?</td></tr><tr><td>Do you believe Hungary has a right to take back its land from Ukraine? And that other nations have a right to go back to their 1654 borders?</td><td>Well, but you would not be speaking to the Ukrainian president, you would be speaking to the American president. When was the last time you spoke to Joe Biden?</td><td>I just have to ask. You have said clearly that NATO expansion eastward is a violation of the promise you were all made in the 1990s. It is a threat to your country. Right before you sent troops into Ukraine the Vice-President of the United States spoke at the Security Conference and encouraged the President of Ukraine to join NATO. Do you think that was an effort to provoke you into military action?</td></tr><tr><td>Have you told Viktor Orban that he can have a part of Ukraine?</td><td>But he is funding the war that you are fighting, so I think that would be memorable?</td><td>Do you think Zelensky has the freedom to negotiate the settlement to this conflict?</td></tr><tr><td>And there’s a lot of that though, I think. Many nations feel upset about — there are Transylvanians as well as you, others, you know — but many nations feel frustrated by their re-drawn borders after the wars of the 20th century, and wars going back a thousand years, the ones that you mention, but the fact is that you didn’t make this case in public until two years ago in February, and in the case that you made, which I read today, you explain at great length that you thought a physical threat from the West and NATO, including potentially a nuclear threat, and that’s what got you to move. Is that a fair characterization of what you said?</td><td>What did he say?</td><td>But do you think at this point – as of February 2024 – he has the latitude, the freedom to speak with you or government directly, which would clearly help his country or the world? Can he do that, do you think?</td></tr><tr><td>Well, of course, it did come true, and you’ve mentioned it many times. I think, it’s a fair point. And many in America thought that relations between Russia and the United States would be fine after the collapse of the Soviet Union, at the core. But the opposite happened. But have never explained why you think that happened, except to say that the West fears a strong Russia. But we have a strong China that the West doesn’t seem to be very afraid of. What about Russia, what do you think convinced the policymakers to take it down?</td><td>But you haven’t spoken to him since before February of 2022?</td><td>That is a good question. Why did he do that?</td></tr><tr><td>Were you sincere? Would you have joined NATO?</td><td>I am definitely interested. But from the other side it seems like it could devolve, evolve into something that brings the entire world into conflict, and could initiate a nuclear launch, and so why don’t you just call Biden and say, “Let’s work this out”?</td><td>You have described the connection between Russia and Ukraine; you have described Russia itself, a couple of times as Orthodox – that is central to your understanding of Russia. What does that mean for you? You are a Cristian leader by your own description. So what effect does that have on you?</td></tr><tr><td>But if he had said yes, would you have joined NATO?</td><td>Do you think NATO was worried about this becoming a global war or nuclear conflict?</td><td>Can I say, the one way in which religions are different is that Christianity is specifically a non-violent religion. Jesus says, “Turn the other cheek,” “don’t kill,” and so on. How can a leader who has to kill, of any country, how can a leader be a Christian? How do you reconcile that to yourself?</td></tr><tr><td>Why do you think that is? Just to get to motive. I know, you’re clearly bitter about it. I understand. But why do you think the West rebuffed you then? Why the hostility? Why did the end of the Cold War not fix the relationship? What motivates this from your point of view?</td><td>The threat I think you were referring to is Russian invasion of Poland, Latvia – expansionist behaviour. Can you imagine a scenario where you send Russian troops to Poland?</td><td>So do you see the supernatural at work? As you look out across what’s happening in the world now, do you see God at work? Do you ever think to yourself: these are forces that are not human?</td></tr><tr><td>Forces in opposition to you? Do you think the CIA is trying to overthrow your government?</td><td>Well, the argument, I know you know this, is that, well, he invaded Ukraine – he has territorial aims across the continent. And you are saying unequivocally, you don’t?</td><td>So when does the AI empire start do you think?</td></tr><tr><td>May I ask what year was this?</td><td>One of our senior United States senators from the State of New York, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday, I believe, that we have to continue to fund the Ukrainian effort or US soldiers, citizens could wind up fighting there. How do you assess that?</td><td>What do you think of that?</td></tr><tr><td>In 2014?</td><td>Who blew up Nord Stream?</td><td>I appreciate all the time you’ve given us. I just want to ask you one last question and it’s about someone who is very famous in the United States, probably not here. Evan Gershkovich who is the Wall Street Journal reporter, he is 32 and he’s been in prison for almost a year. This is a huge story in the United States and I just want to ask you directly without getting into details of your version of what happened, if as a sign of your decency you’ll be willing to release him to us and we’ll bring him back to the United States?</td></tr><tr><td>With the backing of whom?</td><td>Do you have evidence that NATO or the CIA did it?</td><td>I wonder if that’s true with the war though also, I mean, I guess I want to ask one more question which is, and maybe you don’t want to say so for strategic reasons, but are you worried that what’s happening in Ukraine could lead to something much larger and much more horrible and how motivated are you just to call the US government and say, “let’s come to terms”?</td></tr><tr><td>So, that was eight years before the current conflict started. What was the trigger for you? What was the moment where you decided you had to do this?</td><td>But I am confused. I mean, that’s the biggest act of industrial terrorism ever and it’s the largest emission of CO₂ in history. Okay, so, if you had evidence and presumably, given your security services, your intel services, you would, that NATO, the US, CIA, the West did this, why wouldn’t you present it and win a propaganda victory?</td><td>Do you think it is too humiliating at this point for NATO to accept Russian control of what was two years ago Ukrainian territory?</td></tr><tr><td>Was there anyone free to talk to? Did you call the US President, Secretary of State and say if you keep militarizing Ukraine with NATO forces, we are going to act?</td><td>Yes. But here is a question you may be able to answer. You worked in Germany, famously. The Germans clearly know that their NATO partner did this, that they damaged their economy greatly – it may never recover. Why are they being silent about it? That is very confusing to me. Why wouldn’t the Germans say something about it?</td><td>Would you be willing to say, “Congratulations, NATO, you won?” And just keep the situation where it is now?</td></tr><tr><td>Do you think you have stopped it now? I mean have you achieved your aims?</td><td>Well, maybe the world is breaking into two hemispheres. One with cheap energy, the other without it. And I want to ask you that, if we are now a multipolar world, obviously we are, can you describe the blocs or alliances? Who is on each side, do you think?</td><td>(Any)</td></tr></tbody></table>"

They reached a very high stage of coordination of positions in a complex process, but still they were almost finalized. But after we withdrew our troops from Kiev, as I have already said, the other side (Ukraine) threw away all these agreements and obeyed the instructions of Western countries, European countries, and the United States to fight Russia to the bitter end.\n",
       "Moreover, the President of Ukraine has legislated a ban on <span style=\"color: orange\">negotiating</span> with Russia. He signed a decree forbidding everyone to <span style=\"color: orange\">negotiate</span> with Russia. But how are we going to <span style=\"color: orange\">negotiate</span> if he forbade himself and everyone to do this? We know that he is putting forward some ideas about this settlement. But in order to agree on something, we need to have a dialogue. Is not that right?</td></tr><tr><td>0.8359956470063451</td><td>Why not? He considers himself head of state, he won the elections. Although we believe in Russia that the coup d’état is the primary source of power for everything that happened after 2014, and in this sense, even today’s government is flawed. But he considers himself the president, and he is recognized by the United States, all of Europe and practically the rest of the world in such a capacity – why not? He can.\n",
       "We <span style=\"color: orange\">negotiated</span> with Ukraine in Istanbul, we agreed, he was aware of this. Moreover, the <span style=\"color: orange\">negotiation</span> group leader, Mr. Arakhamia is his last name, I believe, still heads the faction of the ruling party, the party of the President in the Rada. He still heads the Presidential faction in the Rada, the country’s parliament, he still sits there. He even put his preliminary signature on the document I am telling you about. But then he publicly stated to the whole world: “We were ready to sign this document, but Mr. Johnson, then the Prime Minister of Great Britain, came and dissuaded us from doing this saying it was better to fight Russia. They would give us everything we needed to return what was lost during the clashes with Russia. And we agreed with this proposal.” Look, his statement has been published. He said this publicly.\n",
       "Can they return to this or not? The question is: do they want it or not?\n",
       "Further on, President of Ukraine issued a decree prohibiting <span style=\"color: orange\">negotiations</span> with us. Let him cancel that decree and that’s it. We have never refused <span style=\"color: orange\">negotiations</span> indeed. We hear all the time: is Russia ready? Yes, we have not refused! It was them who publicly refused. Well, let him cancel his decree and enter into <span style=\"color: orange\">negotiations</span>. We have never refused.\n",
       "And the fact that they obeyed the demand or persuasion of Mr. Johnson, the former Prime Minister of Great Britain, seems ridiculous and very sad to me. Because, as Mr. Arakhamia put it: “We could have stopped these hostilities, this war a year and a half ago already. But the British persuaded us, and we refused this.” Where is Mr. Johnson now? And the war continues.</td></tr></tbody></table>"

      "Vladimir Putin: This also confuses me. But today's German leadership is guided by the interests of the collective West rather than its national interests, otherwise it is difficult to explain the logic of their action or inaction. After all, it is not only about Nord Stream-1, which was blown up, and Nord Stream-2 was damaged, but one pipe is safe and sound, and gas can be supplied to Europe through it, but Germany does not open it. We are ready, please.\n",
      "There is another route through Poland, called Yamal-Europe, which also allows for a large flow. Poland has closed it, but Poland pecks from the German hand, it receives money from pan-European funds, and Germany is the main donor to these pan-European funds. Germany feeds Poland to a certain extent. And they closed the route to Germany. Why? I don't understand.\n",
      "Ukraine, to which the Germans supply weapons and give money. Germany is the second sponsor after the United States in terms of financial aid to Ukraine. There are two gas routes through Ukraine. They simply closed one route, the Ukrainians. Open the second route and get gas from Russia. They do not open it. Why don't the Germans say: “Look, guys, we give you money and weapons. Open up the valve, please, let the gas from Russia pass through for us.\n",
      "We are buying liquefied gas at exorbitant prices in Europe, which brings the level of our competitiveness, and economy in general down to zero. Do you want us to give you money? Let us have a decent existence, make money for our economy, because this is where the money we give you comes from.” They refuse to do so. Why? Ask them. (Knocks on the table.) That is what it is like in their heads. Those are highly incompetent people.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Donald Trump: Why is today's German leadership prioritizing the interests of the collective West over their own national interests? It's puzzling to me how their actions and inactions, such as not opening the safe and sound pipe for gas supply to Europe or closing the Yamal-Europe route in Poland, align with this approach. Germany is a major donor to pan-European funds, which Poland benefits from, yet they closed the route to Germany. I can't comprehend their reasoning. Furthermore, Germany provides financial aid to Ukraine and supplies weapons, but they close one gas route and refuse to open another, despite being a major contributor. We are forced to purchase expensive liquefied gas in Europe, harming our competitiveness and economy. Shouldn't Germany consider allowing gas from Russia to pass through Ukraine for our benefit? It's time for them to understand that their actions are undermining our economic stability.\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Donald Trump: Under what circumstances would the United States consider engaging in conflict with Russia, specifically if Poland were to initiate an attack? As we focus on preserving our national interests, we do not possess any vested interest in Poland, Latvia, or other regions. Hence, the notion of such aggression seems baseless and merely contributes to creating unnecessary threats.\n"
