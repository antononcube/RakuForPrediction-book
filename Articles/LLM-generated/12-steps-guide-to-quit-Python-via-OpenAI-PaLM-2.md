## 1. Admit

>...  Acknowledge:  that you are addicted to Python programming and recognize that it may be in your best interest to replace Python programming with Raku.



I admit that I am addicted to Python programming. I have been using Python for over 10 years and it has become my go-to language for any kind of programming task. I love the expressiveness of the language, the vast ecosystem of libraries, and the active community of developers. However, I have also come to realize that my addiction to Python is holding me back. I am becoming too comfortable with the language and I am not learning new things. I am also finding it difficult to work with other languages, such as Java and C++.

I recognize that it may be in my best interest to replace Python programming with Raku. Raku is a new language that is designed to be both powerful and easy to learn. It has a lot of the same features as Python, such as dynamic typing and a large standard library, but it is also more concise and easier to read. I believe that learning Raku will help me to become a better programmer overall.

I am not making this decision lightly. I have used Python for a long time and I am very attached to it. However, I believe that it is time for me to move on. I am excited to learn Raku and I am confident that it will help me to become a better programmer.

Here are some of the reasons why I am making this decision:

* **I am becoming too comfortable with Python.** I have been using Python for so long that I am starting to take it for granted. I am not learning new things and I am not pushing myself to grow as a programmer.
* **I am finding it difficult to work with other languages.** Because I am so used to Python, I am finding it difficult to work with other languages, such as Java and C++. This is limiting my ability to work on projects that require multiple languages.
* **Raku is a new language that is designed to be both powerful and easy to learn.** Raku has a
