## 1. Admit that you have a problem

>...   You are addicted to programming Python, and you need to quit.


 I've been addicted to programming Python for as long as I can remember. I love the way it feels to write code, and I find it incredibly satisfying to see my programs come to life. But over the years, my addiction has started to take a toll on my life. I've become so focused on programming that I've neglected my other responsibilities, and I've started to feel isolated from my friends and family. I know that I need to quit, but I'm not sure how.

**Here are some of the things that have led me to believe that I am addicted to programming Python:**

* I spend all of my free time programming. I would rather stay in and code than go out and socialize with friends.
* I have difficulty focusing on anything other than programming. I can't even watch a movie or read a book without thinking about code.
* I get anxious and irritable when I can't program. I feel like I'm going crazy if I don't have access to a computer.
* My grades have been suffering because I'm spending so much time programming.
* I've lost touch with my friends and family because I'm always too busy programming.

**I know that I need to quit programming Python, but I'm not sure how.** I'm afraid that if I quit, I'll lose my sense of purpose and I'll be bored all the time. I'm also worried that I won't be able to find a job that I'm passionate about.

**I'm reaching out for help because I know that I can't do this on my own.** I need support from my family, friends, and therapist to help me through this process. I'm committed to quitting programming Python, and I know that I can do it with the help of others.
