>...  Acknowledge that the addiction exists: Recognize the impact that Python programming has had on your life, and admit the need to cut back.



There are many ways to acknowledge that a Python programming addiction exists. One way is to recognize the impact that Python programming has had on your life. For example, you may have noticed that you spend more and more time coding, even when you have other obligations. You may also find that you are unable to stop thinking about Python programming, even when you are not actively coding. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to acknowledge that you may have a problem.

Another way to acknowledge that a Python programming addiction exists is to admit the need to cut back. This can be difficult, especially if you are passionate about Python programming. However, it is important to remember that your addiction is negatively impacting your life. By cutting back on your Python programming, you can improve your overall well-being.

Here are some tips for acknowledging that a Python programming addiction exists:

* **Be honest with yourself about your Python programming habits.** Do you spend more time coding than you would like? Do you find it difficult to stop thinking about Python programming? If so, it is likely that you have a problem.
* **Talk to someone you trust about your addiction.** This could be a friend, family member, therapist, or other professional. Talking about your addiction can help you to gain perspective and support.
* **Seek professional help.** If you are struggling to control your Python programming addiction, it is important to seek professional help. A therapist can help you to identify the root of your addiction and develop strategies for overcoming it.

Acknowledgement is the first step towards recovery from any addiction. By acknowledging that you have a problem, you can take the necessary steps to get help and improve your life.

>...  Make a transition plan: Create a plan for how you will transition from Python to Raku.



## Transition Plan from Python to Raku

This transition plan outlines the steps I will take to move from Python to Raku.

### 1. Learn the basics of Raku

The first step is to learn the basics of Raku. This includes learning the syntax, data types, and control structures. I will do this by reading books, articles, and tutorials, and by working through exercises.

### 2. Evaluate Raku's features and capabilities

Once I have a basic understanding of Raku, I will evaluate its features and capabilities. This includes comparing it to Python in terms of performance, expressiveness, and ecosystem. I will also consider my own needs and preferences to determine if Raku is a good fit for me.

### 3. Start using Raku in small projects

Once I have decided that Raku is a good fit for me, I will start using it in small projects. This will help me to get familiar with the language and to build my confidence. I will start with simple projects and gradually work my way up to more complex projects.

### 4. Continue learning Raku

As I continue to use Raku, I will continue to learn the language. This includes learning new features, reading about best practices, and participating in the Raku community. I will also keep an eye on the development of Raku and track new releases.

### 5. Migrate my Python code to Raku

Once I am comfortable with Raku, I will start to migrate my Python code to Raku. This will be a gradual process, and I will only migrate code that is ready to be migrated. I will use a test-driven approach to ensure that the migrated code is correct.

### 6. Continue using Raku

Once I have migrated my Python code to Raku, I will continue to use Raku for all of my new projects. I will also continue to learn the language and to contribute to the Raku community.

>...  Uninstall Python: Delete Python from your computer to avoid temptation.



Uninstalling Python is a simple process that can be completed in just a few steps. Here are the instructions:

1. Open the **Control Panel**.
2. Go to **Programs and Features**.
3. Find **Python** in the list of programs.
4. Click **Uninstall**.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the uninstall process.

Once Python has been uninstalled, it will no longer be available on your computer. This means that you will not be able to run Python programs or use any Python libraries. If you decide that you want to reinstall Python in the future, you can do so by following the instructions on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Note:** Uninstalling Python will not delete any of your Python projects or files. If you want to delete your Python projects or files, you can do so manually by following these instructions:

1. Open the **File Explorer**.
2. Go to the folder where your Python projects or files are located.
3. Select the files or folders that you want to delete.
4. Press **Delete**.

Once you have deleted your Python projects or files, they will be permanently removed from your computer.

Learn the basics of Raku, including its syntax and capabilities.

Raku is a general-purpose programming language that is designed to be both powerful and easy to use. It is a multi-paradigm language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. Raku's syntax is similar to Perl, but it has been simplified and improved. Raku is also a dynamically typed language, which means that you do not need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it.

Here are some of the basics of Raku that you should know:

* **Variables** are declared using the `my` keyword. For example, `my $name = "John Doe"`.
* **Data types** include numbers, strings, arrays, hashes, and objects.
* **Operators** are used to perform operations on data. For example, the `+` operator adds two numbers together.
* **Control structures** are used to control the flow of execution of a program. For example, the `if` statement checks a condition and executes code if the condition is true.
* **Functions** are used to group together related code. For example, you could create a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

Raku is a powerful and versatile language that can be used to develop a wide variety of applications. If you are interested in learning more about Raku, there are a number of resources available online.

>...  Create a practice project: Create a practice project that allows you to explore and apply Raku.



## Practice Project: A simple text adventure game

This project will create a simple text adventure game in Raku. The game will be played in the terminal, and the player will be able to explore a world, interact with objects, and solve puzzles.

### Step 1: Create a new Raku project

To create a new Raku project, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```
raku new my-text-adventure-game
```

This will create a new directory called `my-text-adventure-game`, which will contain a file called `my-text-adventure-game.raku`. This file will be the main entry point for your game.

### Step 2: Define the world

The first thing you need to do is define the world of your game. This includes creating the rooms, objects, and characters that will appear in the game.

You can define the world in any way you want, but for this example, we'll create a simple world with three rooms: a starting room, a room with a treasure chest, and a room with a monster.

The starting room will contain a character called "the player". The player will be able to move between the three rooms, interact with objects, and fight monsters.

```
# Define the rooms

my @rooms = (
    {
        "name" => "starting_room",
        "description" => "You are in a small room. There is a door to the north and a door to the east.",
        "characters" => [
            "player"
        ],
        "objects" => [
            "chest"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name" => "treasure_room",
        "description" => "You are in a large room. There is a treasure chest in
```
